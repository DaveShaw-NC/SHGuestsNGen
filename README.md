# SHGuestsNGen
Next Generation Guest processing for Samaritan House, Inc.
Written in C# and using Entity Framework 6.1.3 to access SQL Server 2016.
Database is now a relational database. Has One Guest record and multiple records for Visits, if present.
This is subject to change is a better idea strikes me.
